**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**Project : BASIC AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM**

**OBJECTIVE**
The objective of this project is to create a secure user authentication system using Flask, enabling users to register, log in, and log out, with password hashing and session management.

**KEY ACTIVITIES**


1. **Setting Up Flask Application:**
   - Initialize Flask app and configure secret key and database URI.

2. **Database Management:**
   - Use SQLAlchemy to define the `User` model and manage database operations.
   - Create and initialize the database.

3. **Password Security:**
   - Implement password hashing with Bcrypt to ensure secure storage of user passwords.

4. **User Authentication:**
   - Set up user registration, including form handling and password hashing.
   - Implement user login functionality with session management using Flask-Login.
   - Create login-required routes to restrict access to authenticated users.

5. **User Session Management:**
   - Use Flask-Login to manage user sessions, ensuring users stay logged in across requests.

6. **User Feedback:**
   - Provide user feedback with flash messages for successful registration, login, and logout operations.

7. **HTML Templating:**
   - Use Flask's `render_template` to render HTML pages for registration, login, and home.

8. **Routing:**
   - Define routes for registration, login, home, and logout functionalities.

9. **Application Execution:**
   - Ensure the application runs in debug mode for development purposes.
